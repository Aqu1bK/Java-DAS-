Introduction To Greedy

Greedy algorithms is the problem solving technique where we make the locally optimum choice at each 
stage & hope to achieve a global optimum.

Pros
Simple and Easy to understand and Implement.
Good Enough TC (Time complexity).

Cons
A lot of time, global optimum is not achieved.
