**Abstraction** is one of the **four pillars of OOP** (with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism).

---

### ‚úÖ Definition

**Abstraction** is the process of **hiding implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** of an object.

‚û°Ô∏è It focuses on **what an object does**, not **how it does it**.
‚û°Ô∏è Helps reduce complexity and makes code easier to use.

### üîπ Real-life Example

* When you **drive a car**, you just use:

  * Steering wheel
  * Accelerator
  * Brake

You **don‚Äôt need to know** how the engine, gearbox, or fuel injection system works.
That‚Äôs **abstraction** ‚Üí showing only the necessary functionality, hiding the details.

### üîπ Abstraction in Java

In Java, abstraction can be achieved in **two ways**:

1. **Abstract Classes** (0‚Äì100% abstraction)

   * Declared using `abstract` keyword.
   * Can have **abstract methods** (without implementation) and **concrete methods** (with implementation).

   Example:

   ```java
   abstract class Animal {
       abstract void sound(); // abstract method (no body)
       
       void sleep() {         // concrete method
           System.out.println("Sleeping...");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal a = new Dog();
           a.sound();  // Dog barks
           a.sleep();  // Sleeping...
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Interfaces** (100% abstraction before Java 8; now can have default & static methods too)

   * All methods are **abstract by default** (before Java 8).
   * A class **implements** an interface.

   Example:

   ```java
   interface Vehicle {
       void start();
   }

   class Car implements Vehicle {
       public void start() {
           System.out.println("Car starts with a key");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Vehicle v = new Car();
           v.start();  // Car starts with a key
       }
   }
   ```

### ‚ö° Key Points

* **Abstraction = Hiding implementation, exposing functionality.**
* Achieved using:

  * **Abstract classes**
  * **Interfaces**
* Benefits:

  * Reduces complexity
  * Increases reusability
  * Improves security (users only see what‚Äôs necessary)

üëâ Do you want me to also give you a **difference table: Abstraction vs Encapsulation** (since people often confuse them)?
