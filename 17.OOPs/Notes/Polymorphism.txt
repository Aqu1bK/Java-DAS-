Polymorphism is one of the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (alongside **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Abstraction**).

The word comes from Greek: **"poly" = many, "morph" = forms** ‚Üí *many forms*.

In programming, \**polymorphism allows a single entity (like a function, method, or operator) to behave differently depending on the context*.

### ‚úÖ Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding / Early Binding)**

   * Decided at compile time.
   * Achieved using:

     * **Method Overloading** ‚Üí multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
     * **Operator Overloading** (in some languages like C++) ‚Üí same operator (`+`, `*`) used for different data types.

   Example (Java - method overloading):

   ```java
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }
       double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

   Here, `add()` has **many forms** depending on parameter types.

---

2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding / Late Binding)**

   * Decided at runtime.
   * Achieved using **Method Overriding** ‚Üí when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in its parent class.
   * Requires **inheritance** and **upcasting**.

   Example (Java - method overriding):

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal a = new Dog(); // upcasting
           a.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
       }
   }
   ```

   Even though the reference is of type `Animal`, the actual method called depends on the **object type at runtime**.

---

### üîë In short:

* **Polymorphism** = one interface, many implementations.
* It makes code more **flexible, reusable, and maintainable**.

üëâ Do you want me to also explain **real-life examples** of polymorphism (like in banking, shapes, etc.) to make it more intuitive?


Method Overloading

**Method Overloading** is a form of **compile-time polymorphism** in Object-Oriented Programming.

It means:
‚û°Ô∏è **Same method name**
‚û°Ô∏è **Different parameter list** (number of parameters, type of parameters, or order of parameters)
‚û°Ô∏è Decided at **compile time** which method to call.

---

### ‚úÖ Rules of Method Overloading

1. Must have **same method name**.
2. Must differ in **parameter list**:

   * Number of parameters
   * Type of parameters
   * Order of parameters
3. **Return type alone does NOT differentiate** methods. (Changing only return type will cause a compile error).

---

### üîπ Example in Java

```java
class MathOperations {
    // Method with 2 int parameters
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Method with 3 int parameters
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Method with double parameters
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations obj = new MathOperations();
        
        System.out.println(obj.add(5, 10));        // calls add(int, int)
        System.out.println(obj.add(5, 10, 15));    // calls add(int, int, int)
        System.out.println(obj.add(5.5, 10.5));    // calls add(double, double)
    }
}
```

---

### ‚ö° Key Point

* Overloading increases **readability and reusability** (same logical operation but different input types).
* It is **not** related to inheritance, unlike **method overriding**.

üëâ Do you want me to also explain the **difference between method overloading and method overriding** (side-by-side comparison)?


Method Overriding 

**Method Overriding** is a form of **runtime polymorphism** in OOP.

It happens when:
‚û°Ô∏è A **subclass** (child class) provides a **specific implementation** of a method that is already defined in its **superclass** (parent class).
‚û°Ô∏è The **method name, parameters, and return type must be the same**.
‚û°Ô∏è The call is resolved **at runtime**, depending on the object being referred to.

---

### ‚úÖ Rules of Method Overriding

1. Must be in **two classes** with inheritance.
2. Method in the child class must have:

   * **Same name**
   * **Same parameter list**
   * **Same return type (or covariant return type)**
3. The method in the child class should have an **equal or more accessible modifier** (e.g., can‚Äôt reduce `public` to `private`).
4. The overridden method cannot be `static`, `final`, or `private` (because those cannot be overridden).

---

### üîπ Example in Java

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {   // overriding the parent class method
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // upcasting
        a.sound();  // Output: Dog barks (runtime decision)
    }
}
```

Here:

* `sound()` is **overridden** in the `Dog` class.
* Even though the reference type is `Animal`, the actual object is `Dog`, so the **child class method executes at runtime**.

---

### ‚ö° Key Difference vs Method Overloading

* **Overloading** ‚Üí Same class, compile-time decision.
* **Overriding** ‚Üí Different classes (parent-child), runtime decision.
